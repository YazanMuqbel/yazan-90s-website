I’ve built my life around **placing small bets** — little experiments in business, relationships, and creativity.

Why? Because when you increase your *surface area of luck*, good things find you.

## 3 Things I’ve Learned
1. Start small — avoid risking everything on one move.
2. Learn fast — treat each bet as data.
3. Stay visible — share what you’re doing.
