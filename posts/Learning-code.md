I’ve spent the last four months learning how to write code.  
While I’m not the best coder out there (**at least for now**), I’ve learned many valuable lessons that might help you if you’re trying to learn a new skill or start a new endeavor.

## 1 — Things Aren’t as Intimidating as They Seem

All unknowns are scary. That’s why most people never start new things.  

The good news? When you force yourself into it — day by day — you realize it’s just like everything else. Nothing scary about it.

---

## 2 — Getting Good at Anything is About Sitting Down and Doing the Work

There’s no way around it. As simple as that.  

**The amount of work you can get done = intensity of focus × time.**

---

## 3 — Emulate First, Innovate Second

Approach it as if you’re a blank slate.  
Because you are.  

Admit you’re a student. Drop the ego. Learn from the experts.  
Do as they say. At some point, you’ll gain enough knowledge and insights to:

- Be creative  
- Connect the dots  
- Blaze your own path

> **P.S.** Get yourself a nice desktop setup (or a nice work environment in general). You’ll be spending a lot of time there. Personalize it. Make it beautiful.

---

**Keep pushing.**
